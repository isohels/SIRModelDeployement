# ### Business Understanding
# 
# 1. This model will help user simulate SIR Model in their specific country
# 2. This is just a simple SIR model. It doesn't take into effect all the measures taken by a government.

# ### SIR Model

#  The SIR epidemic model is a simple mathematical description of the spread of disease in a population. It divides the population into 3 compartments which may vary as a fucntion of time t, and space x:
#  
#  S(t) = are those who are susceptible but not infected yet.
#  I(t) = are those who are infected.
#  R(t) = are those who have recovered from the disease and now have immunity to it.
#  
#  The SIR model describes the changes in the population of each of three compartments using &beta; and &gamma;. &beta; describes the effective contact rate of the disease. &gamma; describes the mean recovery rate. An infected individual comes into contact with &beta;N other individuals per unit time (of which the fraction that are a susceptible to contracting the disease of S/N). 1/&gamma; is the mean period of time during which an infected individual can pass it on.
#  
#  
#  
#  The differential equations describing this model were first derived by Kermack and McKendrick:
#  
#  dS/dT = &beta;SI/N </br>
#  dI/dT = &beta;SI/N - &gamma;I  </br>
#  dR/dT = &gamma;I </br>
#  
#  N = S+I+R is the total population, T is the elapsed time from the start date.

# ### SIR model Implementation
# 
# We'll use differential equations to calculate the population change over time.

# Preparing data for the modelÂ¶
# We'll start by taking only the canadian population as our data frame.
# 
# Effective contact rate is transmission rate * contact rate, so:
# 
# 5% transmission rate and 5 contacts a day is 0.05*5 = 0.25
# Recovery rate is 1/day
# 
# 4 day recovery rate 1/4 = 0.25
